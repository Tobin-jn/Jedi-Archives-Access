#SWAPIBox

This project is a React App the is designed to challenge the developer to make a series of fetch calls to [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/), an unsecured api with a programmatically accessible data source for all the data from the Star Wars canon universe. The developers/designers on this project are Kevin Simpson and Tobin Nelson.

SWAPIBox is an assigment as a part of the front end engineering program at The Turing School of Software and Design in Denver, CO as a part of the third module. You can find the [project specs here](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html). Most students working on this project have only been coding for sixteen-to-twenty three weeks using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. React has only become a part of our skill set as of seven weeks ago.

Originally, we decided to approach the layout and design quite literally based on the project specs:

We imagined the movie crawl text from a random Star Wars film scrolling up the left side while users could access data relating to characters, vehicles, and planets from the series on the right. After a few days, this design felt not only dated, but was becoming an overwhelming theme throughout the class. Consequently, we stripped the layout down to the foundation and rebuilt it with a very specific theme: the user is effecetively role-playing a Jedi Master at some point during the established Star Wars film narrative, and they are logging into a secure data interface that imparts a narrative connection sequence, a situation report (the random film crawl text), and a series of access points relaying information about people, places, and transports that are pertinent to their mission.
